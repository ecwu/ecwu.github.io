Alongside catching up with friends on a tight schedule, testing my first roll of CineStill 800T became a side mission. I also brought along a roll of expired Kodak Portra 400 and ILFORD HP5 Plus, as they had been sitting in my fridge for quite some time.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="cinestill-800t">Cinestill 800T&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The film isn’t a brand-new release; I heard about its big name from lots of film photograph KOLs at least 3 years ago. This film is basically Kodak&amp;rsquo;s Vision 3 5219 (500T) movie film. A distinctive feature of movie film is it comes with a Remjet layer, a black carbon coating designed to prevent light halation. which is a layer of black carbon coating (calls remjet) on the back of the film to prevents light halation. Traditionally, the film with a remjet layer require one extra step during develop process to remove it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Hong Kong, and Kodak Gold</title><link>https://ecwuuuuu.com/photography/gz-sz-hk-and-kodak-gold/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Oct 2024 23:59:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://ecwuuuuu.com/photography/gz-sz-hk-and-kodak-gold/</guid><description>&lt;p>After completing my master’s degree following the COVID-19 outbreak, I transitioned into full-time work. Life became busy, and I gradually set aside my film camera. Recently, I purchased Kodak Gold 200 in 120 format—Kodak’s latest film—during a visit to Guangzhou (新丽照相器材商店). I had planned to capture a few moments before leaving China. I took the film along on a three-day trip to Guangzhou, Shenzhen, and Hong Kong. Eventually, I had the film developed at GZNow Lab in Guangzhou.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>500 Hours in 307</title><link>https://ecwuuuuu.com/photography/500hrsin307/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Apr 2022 16:07:13 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://ecwuuuuu.com/photography/500hrsin307/</guid><description>&lt;p>This work is the final project of the Photography FE (Free Elective) Course. It shows how I am &amp;ldquo;living&amp;rdquo; in classroom 307 of the laboratory building.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In June 2019, about to be my senior year, I started my graduation project. Academic research requires long-term devotion, so classroom 307, as our stronghold, became where I spent the longest time in my last year of college (since COVID-19 destroyed the second semester). I spent more than 500 hours staying in that place. To study, do experiments, rest, and entertain.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Figure: Hinata Shoyo</title><link>https://ecwuuuuu.com/photography/hinata-shoyo/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jan 2022 22:04:44 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://ecwuuuuu.com/photography/hinata-shoyo/</guid><description>&lt;p>Note:&lt;/p>

In the evening, we saw a nice sunset in &lt;a href="http://en.sasac.gov.cn/2020/10/09/c_5587.htm">OH BAY&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the way back home, I saw more breathtaking scenery. And I captured it with my camera.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The images are shot using a slow shutter speed, and the shape of the objects is dragged by the movement of the cabin. I arrange the image in a linear (both in time and space) manner. Along with intertwined artificial lights, urban buildings, and twilight sky in the frame. I try to create an emotional transition from active to calm with these four images.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Outside Windowsill</title><link>https://ecwuuuuu.com/photography/outside-windowsill/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Dec 2020 21:30:01 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://ecwuuuuu.com/photography/outside-windowsill/</guid><description>&lt;p>The window of my room is facing west. Clear view, not blockage. A perfect place for seeing the gorgeous sunset.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I can’t really remember when and why I start taking photos from the window. Maybe because of the breathtaking scenery, or just some casual shots. But the first one I can find on my Instagram is taken in March 2014.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Haven’t thought about making it into a series or project since the beginning. But I have shot a lot of these since 2014 and I think it will be interesting to make it into a series. And this is the result, hope you enjoy it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Beijing Daxing International Airport</title><link>https://ecwuuuuu.com/photography/pkx-airport/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Jul 2020 15:20:01 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://ecwuuuuu.com/photography/pkx-airport/</guid><description/></item><item><title>UIC night</title><link>https://ecwuuuuu.com/photography/uic-night/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Jul 2020 21:43:01 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://ecwuuuuu.com/photography/uic-night/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Television Studio Production @ HKBU</title><link>https://ecwuuuuu.com/photography/television-studio-production-at-hkbu/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Aug 2018 02:56:01 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://ecwuuuuu.com/photography/television-studio-production-at-hkbu/</guid><description>&lt;p>Television Studio Production 电视影棚制作&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hong Kong Flashback</title><link>https://ecwuuuuu.com/photography/photographs-took-in-hong-konng/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jul 2018 13:56:01 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://ecwuuuuu.com/photography/photographs-took-in-hong-konng/</guid><description>&lt;p>一些我 2018 年暑假在香港期间拍摄的一些照片&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>

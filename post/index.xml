      <description>Recently, been asked a question on using neural networks for binary classification.
 The output layer of the network can be &amp;hellip; One output neuron with sigmoid activation function or Two neurons and then apply a softmax activation function. But what is the difference between these two?
 Let start with the equations of the two functions.
Sigmoid Activation Function $$ S(x) = \frac{1}{ 1+e^{-x}} $$
We input the value of the last layer $x$, and we can get a value in the range 0 to 1 as shown in the figure.</description>

      <description>Although I majored in computer science, my blog is filled with photography-related content. For balance, I take the opportunity of a recent explore and write down this note. :-)
  Spoiler alert: This is not the way I currently using to exposed my NAS to the WWW.
 Some Background I own a Synology DS918+ NAS, which was purchased in 2020. Both ports on the NAS are connected to my ASUS AC68U router for redundancy.</description>

      <description>In my last photography-related post: Try the Film For the First Time. I have lots of fun with negatives. This makes me want to have my own camera to experience this medium that has existed for nearly 200 years.  The film we are still using today was invented by Kodak in 1888, but photosensitive material that uses in photography can date back to 1835. ⊕ View from the Window at Le Gras  Jonnychiwa [CC BY-SA 4.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The story starts from a disposable camera sent to me by &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/russelloop&#34;&gt;Root&lt;/a&gt; in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

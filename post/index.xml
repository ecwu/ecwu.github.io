      <description>What I have done When creating the theme announced in the post Switching to a new theme &amp;hellip; I guess. I set up a new branch in the original source repository and uses Cloudflare pages to build the previews for the site. This can make sure all the original Github actions for the main site working normally.
Since the new branch new-theme was created using attribute --orphan, it will be impossible to do pull requests to the original default branch master.</description>

      <description>This blogsite has been using hugo-tufte theme (with some customization) for a while. I choose the theme because I appreciate the aesthetic look of the original Tufte $\LaTeX$ template. Using a dedicated area on the right side of the page for sidenotes, supplements images, or thoughts. Diversify the layout of an article, and make the article fun to read.
A couple of months ago, under my willingness of making enhancements to the theme.</description>

      <description>Starting from Aug 11, 2021. I am starting a new domain name for my website.
 ecwu.xyz
 Personally, the old domain name (ecwuuuuu.com) is good but is it a little bit longer in length and maybe difficult for people to memorize and use. So, I register this domain name to create some convenience for others (but mostly for myself :)).
Currently, I am don&amp;rsquo;t have a concrete plan for how to utilize these two domains.</description>

      <description>Recently, been asked a question on using neural networks for binary classification.
 The output layer of the network can be &amp;hellip; One output neuron with sigmoid activation function or Two neurons and then apply a softmax activation function. But what is the difference between these two?
 Let start with the equations of the two functions.
Sigmoid Activation Function $$ S(x) = \frac{1}{ 1+e^{-x}} $$
We input the value of the last layer $x$, and we can get a value in the range 0 to 1 as shown in the figure.</description>

      <description>I started to learn NLP-related stuff in mid-2018. And gradually start to some serious research. My focus mainly on Natural Language Generation (NLG).
Beginning: SemEval2019 By the end of 2018, members of the AI learning group Lead by Prof. Weifeng Su decide to take part in the SemEval 2019. To study and learning more about NLP.
Our group chose task 6: Identifying and Categorizing Offensive Language in Social Media (OffensEval). Which the input text is users&#39; tweets and we need to classify it.</description>

      <description>Although I majored in computer science, my blog is filled with photography-related content.

      <description>In my last photography-related post: Try the Film For the First Time. I have lots of fun with negatives. This makes me want to have my own camera to experience this medium that has existed for nearly 200 years. The film we are still using today was invented by Kodak in 1888, but photosensitive material that uses in photography can date back to 1835. View from the Window at Le</description>

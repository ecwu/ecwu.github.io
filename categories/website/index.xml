      <description>Background In the Synology DDNS Tutorial, I have a section on setting up firewall on an ASUS AC68U Router. For a recent update on my home network, the Asus router has been replaced with two Linksys WI-FI 6 tri-band mesh routers (two MX5300 or it&amp;rsquo;s SKU MX10600-CN)ã€‚ I thought it will be easy to set up since I already</description>

      <description>What I have done When creating the theme announced in the post Switching to a new theme &amp;hellip; I guess. I set up a new branch in the original source repository and uses Cloudflare pages to build the previews for the site. This can make sure all the original Github actions for the main site working normally.
Since the new branch new-theme was created using attribute --orphan, it will be impossible to do pull requests to the original default branch master.</description>

      <description>This blogsite has been using hugo-tufte theme (with some customization) for a while. I choose the theme because I appreciate the aesthetic look of the original Tufte $\LaTeX$ template. Using a dedicated area on the right side of the page for sidenotes, supplements images, or thoughts. Diversify the layout of an article, and make the article fun to read.
A couple of months ago, under my willingness of making enhancements to the theme.</description>

      <description>Starting from Aug 11, 2021. I am starting a new domain name for my website.
 ecwu.xyz
 Personally, the old domain name (ecwuuuuu.com) is good but is it a little bit longer in length and maybe difficult for people to memorize and use. So, I register this domain name to create some convenience for others (but mostly for myself :)).
Currently, I am don&amp;rsquo;t have a concrete plan for how to utilize these two domains.</description>

      <description>Although I majored in computer science, my blog is filled with photography-related content. For balance, I take the opportunity of a recent explore and write down this note. :-) Spoiler alert: This is not the way I currently using to exposed my NAS to the WWW. Some Background I own a Synology DS918+ NAS, which was purchased in 2020. Both ports on the NAS are connected to my ASUS AC68U</description>

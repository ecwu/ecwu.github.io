      <description>Hang out with friends in Shenzhen. In the evening, we saw a nice sunset in OH BAY.
On the way back home, I saw more breathtaking scenery. And I captured it with my camera.
The images are shot using a slow shutter speed, and the shape of the objects is dragged by the movement of the cabin. I arrange the image in a linear (both in time and space) manner. Along with intertwined artificial lights, urban buildings, and twilight sky in the frame.</description>

      <description>The window of my room is facing west. Clear view, not blockage. A perfect place for seeing the gorgeous sunset.
I can’t really remember when and why I start taking photos from the window. Maybe because of the breathtaking scenery, or just some casual shots. But the first one I can find on my Instagram is taken in March 2014.
Haven’t thought about making it into a series or project since the beginning.</description>

      <description>In my last photography-related post: Try the Film For the First Time. I have lots of fun with negatives.

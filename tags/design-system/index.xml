&lt;p>Every developer who maintains a blog eventually faces the question: &lt;strong>Should I use an existing theme or build my own?&lt;/strong> For me, this wasn&amp;rsquo;t just about aesthetics - it was about creating the perfect reading experience for both technical tutorials and personal reflections.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After years of blogging on various platforms and using different Hugo themes, I found myself constantly wanting just one more feature, a slightly different margin, or better typography for code blocks. Rather than continuing to patch someone else&amp;rsquo;s theme, I decided to build &lt;strong>ecwu-theme&lt;/strong> from the ground up.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>

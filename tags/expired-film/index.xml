Alongside catching up with friends on a tight schedule, testing my first roll of CineStill 800T became a side mission. I also brought along a roll of expired Kodak Portra 400 and ILFORD HP5 Plus, as they had been sitting in my fridge for quite some time.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The film isnâ€™t a brand-new release; I heard about its big name from lots of film photograph KOLs at least 3 years ago. This film is basically Kodak&amp;rsquo;s Vision 3 5219 (500T) movie film. A distinctive feature of movie film is it comes with a Remjet layer, a black carbon coating designed to prevent light halation. which is a layer of black carbon coating (calls remjet) on the back of the film to prevents light halation. Traditionally, the film with a remjet layer require one extra step during develop process to remove it.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>

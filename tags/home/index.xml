Clear view, not blockage. A perfect place for seeing the gorgeous sunset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can’t really remember when and why I start taking photos from the window. Maybe because of the breathtaking scenery, or just some casual shots. But the first one I can find on my Instagram is taken in March 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Haven’t thought about making it into a series or project since the beginning. But I have shot a lot of these since 2014 and I think it will be interesting to make it into a series. And this is the result, hope you enjoy it.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>

Switching to a new theme ... I guess</title><link>https://ecwuuuuu.com/post/new-theme-for-blog/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Dec 2021 16:35:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ecwuuuuu.com/post/new-theme-for-blog/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This blogsite has been using &lt;a href="https://github.com/shawnohare/hugo-tufte"&gt;hugo-tufte&lt;/a&gt; theme (with some customization) for a while. I choose the theme because I appreciate the aesthetic look of the original Tufte $\LaTeX$ template. Using a dedicated area on the right side of the page for sidenotes, supplements images, or thoughts. Diversify the layout of an article, and make the article fun to read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of months ago, under my willingness of making enhancements to the theme. And I start to do some research on how other people are doing sidenote on their blog (Like the &lt;a href="https://www.gwern.net/Sidenotes"&gt;great article&lt;/a&gt; by Gwern Branwen). With some &amp;ldquo;deep thinking&amp;rdquo;. I start to realize. Maybe it is not a good idea to use footnotes on the Internet pages.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>I am initiating a new domain!</title><link>https://ecwuuuuu.com/post/new-domain/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Sep 2021 14:40:01 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://ecwuuuuu.com/post/new-domain/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Starting from Aug 11, 2021. I am starting a new domain name for my website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://ecwu.xyz"&gt;ecwu.xyz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, the old domain name (ecwuuuuu.com) is good but is it a little bit longer in length and maybe difficult for people to memorize and use. So, I register this domain name to create some convenience for others (but mostly for myself :)).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, I am don&amp;rsquo;t have a concrete plan for how to utilize these two domains. But I will probably migrate all my info page and service to the new domain. The domain email and blog will still keep in the old one. I will keep thinking about this, and sync the progress on this page in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>List of stuff I enjoy</title><link>https://ecwuuuuu.com/page/keep/list-of-stuff-i-enjoy/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Apr 2019 16:23:05 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://ecwuuuuu.com/page/keep/list-of-stuff-i-enjoy/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>

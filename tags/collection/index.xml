      <description>&lt;p&gt;This work is the final project of the Photography FE (Free Elective) Course. It shows how I am &amp;ldquo;living&amp;rdquo; in classroom 307 of the laboratory building.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In June 2019, about to be my senior year, I started my graduation project. Academic research requires long-term devotion, so classroom 307, as our stronghold, became where I spent the longest time in my last year of college (since COVID-19 destroyed the second semester). I spent more than 500 hours staying in that place. To study, do experiments, rest, and entertain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The window of my room is facing west. Clear view, not blockage. A perfect place for seeing the gorgeous sunset.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I can’t really remember when and why I start taking photos from the window. Maybe because of the breathtaking scenery, or just some casual shots. But the first one I can find on my Instagram is taken in March 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Haven’t thought about making it into a series or project since the beginning. But I have shot a lot of these since 2014 and I think it will be interesting to make it into a series. And this is the result, hope you enjoy it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

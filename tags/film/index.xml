      <description>&lt;p&gt;My New Year trip to Shenzhen was another photography trip. Alongside catching up with friends on a tight schedule, testing my first roll of CineStill 800T became a side mission. I also brought along a roll of expired Kodak Portra 400 and ILFORD HP5 Plus, as they had been sitting in my fridge for quite some time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;cinestill-800t&#34;&gt;Cinestill 800T&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The film isn’t a brand-new release; I heard about its big name from lots of film photograph KOLs at least 3 years ago. This film is basically Kodak&amp;rsquo;s Vision 3 5219 (500T) movie film. A distinctive feature of movie film is it comes with a Remjet layer, a black carbon coating designed to prevent light halation. which is a layer of black carbon coating (calls remjet) on the back of the film to prevents light halation. Traditionally, the film with a remjet layer require one extra step during develop process to remove it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After completing my master’s degree following the COVID-19 outbreak, I transitioned into full-time work. Life became busy, and I gradually set aside my film camera. Recently, I purchased Kodak Gold 200 in 120 format—Kodak’s latest film—during a visit to Guangzhou (新丽照相器材商店). I had planned to capture a few moments before leaving China. I took the film along on a three-day trip to Guangzhou, Shenzhen, and Hong Kong. Eventually, I had the film developed at GZNow Lab in Guangzhou.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my last photography-related post: &lt;a href=&#34;https://ecwuuuuu.com/post/try-the-film-for-the-first-time/&#34;&gt;Try the Film For the First Time&lt;/a&gt;. I have lots of fun with negatives. This makes me want to have my own camera to experience this medium that has existed for nearly 200 years. &lt;span class=&#34;px-2 py-1 text-gray-700 bg-gray-300 bg-stripes bg-stripes-white dark:text-gray-400 dark:bg-slate-700 dark:bg-stripes-slate-900 rounded-md&#34;&gt;The film we are still using today was invented by Kodak in 1888, but photosensitive material that uses in photography can date back to 1835.&lt;/span&gt;&#xA;&lt;figure class=&#34;w-full&#34;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;img src=&#34;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8c/View_from_the_Window_at_Le_Gras_colorized_2020_new.png/1600px-View_from_the_Window_at_Le_Gras_colorized_2020_new.png&#34;  class=&#34;rounded-lg&#34;&gt;&#xA;&#xA;  &lt;figcaption&gt;&#xA;  &lt;strong&gt;View from the Window at Le Gras &lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;a href=&#34;https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:View_from_the_Window_at_Le_Gras_colorized_2020_new.png&#34;&gt;&#xA;  Jonnychiwa [CC BY-SA 4.0]&#xA;  &lt;/a&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/figcaption&gt;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The story starts from a disposable camera sent to me by &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/russelloop&#34;&gt;Root&lt;/a&gt; in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

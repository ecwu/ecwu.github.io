      <description>Recently, been asked a question on using neural networks for binary classification.
 The output layer of the network can be &amp;hellip; One output neuron with sigmoid activation function or Two neurons and then apply a softmax activation function. But what is the difference between these two?
 Let start with the equations of the two functions.
Sigmoid Activation Function $$ S(x) = \frac{1}{ 1+e^{-x}} $$
We input the value of the last layer $x$, and we can get a value in the range 0 to 1 as shown in the figure.</description>

      <description>I started to learn NLP-related stuff in mid-2018. And gradually start to some serious research. My focus mainly on Natural Language Generation (NLG).
Beginning: SemEval2019 By the end of 2018, members of the AI learning group Lead by Prof. Weifeng Su decide to take part in the SemEval 2019. To study and learning more about NLP.
Our group chose task 6: Identifying and Categorizing Offensive Language in Social Media (OffensEval). Which the input text is users&#39; tweets and we need to classify it.</description>

&lt;p>Every developer who maintains a blog eventually faces the question: &lt;strong>Should I use an existing theme or build my own?&lt;/strong> For me, this wasn&amp;rsquo;t just about aesthetics - it was about creating the perfect reading experience for both technical tutorials and personal reflections.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After years of blogging on various platforms and using different Hugo themes, I found myself constantly wanting just one more feature, a slightly different margin, or better typography for code blocks. Rather than continuing to patch someone else&amp;rsquo;s theme, I decided to build &lt;strong>ecwu-theme&lt;/strong> from the ground up.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How I Rebuilt a 2018 Project in 2025</title><link>https://ecwuuuuu.com/post/revisit-uiccourse/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Jul 2025 14:10:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://ecwuuuuu.com/post/revisit-uiccourse/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="prelude-the-django-and-jquery-days">Prelude: The Django and jQuery Days&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In 2018, I was self-studying the Django web framework for a college course. To apply what I was learning, I decided to build a project to solve a real problem: our school&amp;rsquo;s course information system.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All official course information was contained within a single, large PDF file. And course details contains in more individual handbooks PDF files. Finding a specific course was a time-consuming process that required extensive scrolling and text searches. I believed I could create a more efficient and user-friendly solution.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>

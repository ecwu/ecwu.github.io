      <description>&lt;p&gt;This work is the final project of the Photography FE (Free Elective) Course. It shows how I am &amp;ldquo;living&amp;rdquo; in classroom 307 of the laboratory building.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In June 2019, about to be my senior year, I started my graduation project. Academic research requires long-term devotion, so classroom 307, as our stronghold, became where I spent the longest time in my last year of college (since COVID-19 destroyed the second semester). I spent more than 500 hours staying in that place. To study, do experiments, rest, and entertain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

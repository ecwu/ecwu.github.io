In the evening, we saw a nice sunset in &lt;a href="http://en.sasac.gov.cn/2020/10/09/c_5587.htm">OH BAY&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the way back home, I saw more breathtaking scenery. And I captured it with my camera.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The images are shot using a slow shutter speed, and the shape of the objects is dragged by the movement of the cabin. I arrange the image in a linear (both in time and space) manner. Along with intertwined artificial lights, urban buildings, and twilight sky in the frame. I try to create an emotional transition from active to calm with these four images.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>

      <description>Hang out with friends in Shenzhen. In the evening, we saw a nice sunset in OH BAY.
On the way back home, I saw more breathtaking scenery. And I captured it with my camera.
The images are shot using a slow shutter speed, and the shape of the objects is dragged by the movement of the cabin. I arrange the image in a linear (both in time and space) manner. Along with intertwined artificial lights, urban buildings, and twilight sky in the frame.</description>

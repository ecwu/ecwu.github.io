      <description>&lt;p&gt;My New Year trip to Shenzhen was another photography trip. Alongside catching up with friends on a tight schedule, testing my first roll of CineStill 800T became a side mission. I also brought along a roll of expired Kodak Portra 400 and ILFORD HP5 Plus, as they had been sitting in my fridge for quite some time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;cinestill-800t&#34;&gt;Cinestill 800T&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The film isn’t a brand-new release; I heard about its big name from lots of film photograph KOLs at least 3 years ago. This film is basically Kodak&amp;rsquo;s Vision 3 5219 (500T) movie film. A distinctive feature of movie film is it comes with a Remjet layer, a black carbon coating designed to prevent light halation. which is a layer of black carbon coating (calls remjet) on the back of the film to prevents light halation. Traditionally, the film with a remjet layer require one extra step during develop process to remove it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After completing my master’s degree following the COVID-19 outbreak, I transitioned into full-time work. Life became busy, and I gradually set aside my film camera. Recently, I purchased Kodak Gold 200 in 120 format—Kodak’s latest film—during a visit to Guangzhou (新丽照相器材商店). I had planned to capture a few moments before leaving China. I took the film along on a three-day trip to Guangzhou, Shenzhen, and Hong Kong. Eventually, I had the film developed at GZNow Lab in Guangzhou.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

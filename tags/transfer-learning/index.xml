&lt;p>A little bit of context&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is the tutorial material I prepared in fall 2023, for people with basic foundation of machine learning to get hands-on PyTorch quickly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My idea behind the whole document is to teach the reader how to do full model training from the ground up and introduce each component alongside the process.&lt;/p>

&lt;li>PyTorch is an open-source deep learning framework that provides a flexible and dynamic approach to building and training neural networks.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Its popularity and widespread adoption by the research and industry communities.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>PyTorch is widely known for its ease of use, Pythonic interface, and excellent support for research-oriented tasks.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>A &lt;strong>computational graph&lt;/strong> represents the flow of data through a computational model in the form of a directed acyclic graph (DAG). It serves as a visual representation of the mathematical operations performed on input data to produce the desired output.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
